# Legacy mobile templates

These templates were previously used for separate mobile-specific rendering paths.

The app now serves full feature templates for mobile and desktop, with mobile behavior handled by:
- shared navbar logic in `templates/_navbar.html`
- responsive/mobile CSS rules in `static/css/styles.css`

This folder is kept as archive/reference only.
